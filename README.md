 ðŸ”¹ Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values in key columns.
   - Standardize text columns (e.g., city names, country codes).
   - Correct inconsistent data types (dates, numbers, strings).

2. **Data Transformation**
   - Create calculated columns such as `Profit` and `Margin`.
   - Merge tables to form a single analysis-ready dataset.
   - Filter out invalid or duplicate entries.

3. **Data Visualization**
   - **Top 10 Products by Sales:** Bar chart.
   - **Top 10 Products by Profit:** Horizontal bar chart.
   - **Sales by Country and Product:** Grouped bar chart.
   - **Customer Distribution by City (UK):** Pie chart.
   - **Top 15 Cities by Customer Count (USA):** Pie chart.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following:

- **Python** (preferably 3.10 or above)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (to run and view the code interactively)  
- **SQL Server** (for accessing the AdventureWorksLT2016 database)  

No other dependencies are strictly required, though additional Python libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly` are used for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
